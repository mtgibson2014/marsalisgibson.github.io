Hello! I am a PhD student at UC Berkeley currently being advised by Alex Bayen. I work on safe reinforcement learning and autonomous driving as part of Berkeley’s Artificial Intelligence Research ([BAIR](https://bair.berkeley.edu/)). In addition to my technical research, I’m also an artist working on simulation development using gaming and animation platforms.

## Current Research
- Safe (Reinforcement) Learning
- Autonomous Driving and Traffic Control
